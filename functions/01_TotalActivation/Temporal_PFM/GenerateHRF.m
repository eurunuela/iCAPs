%% This function generates the HRF matrix for the temporal regularization with Paradigm Free Mapping
%
% Inputs:
% - tr: TR of the acqyisition
% - nscans: number of scans of the acquisition
% - block: 1 if you want to use the block model, 0 if you want to use the spike model
%
% Outputs:
% - X_hrf_norm: Normalized HRF matrix for the temporal regularization
