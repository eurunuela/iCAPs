# REAMDE

Added the following three parameters that are necessary:

- `param.TR`: the TR of the acquisition.
- `param.LambdaPFM`: how to choose the lambda for PFM. As of now, this should be set to "mad".
- `param.custom`: a string with the path to the custom HRF txt file. The txt file should contain a row with the HRF values.
- `param.use_PFM`: whether to use PFM or not. This should be set to 1.
